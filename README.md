# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction-and-Identifying-Key-Predictors-contributing-to-the-disease-
MOTIVATION - Early diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease is essential as the treatment options are more effective when the disease is diagnosed early.
OBJECTIVE - This project aims at building a screening tool which will identify patients at risk to get Parkinson's Disease which can be of much help for Medical Personnel 
•Created a “Prediction” model to predict people who will get Parkinson's Disease using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and SVM to facilitate early diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease, 
•Identified the key predictors causing Parkinson’s Disease using LASSO Regression and analyzed the effect of each of these predictors upon Parkinson’s Disease.
